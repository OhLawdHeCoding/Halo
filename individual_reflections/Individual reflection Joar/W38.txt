This week the biggest hinderance has been working with technology (javascript, react). Since none of us has used it before we have encountered many bugs and progress has been slow. In my case, most of the time has been spent on understanding why my code does not work and little time has been spent on actually producing code. We were able to finish the alotted tasks, but the implementations are very sub-optimal.
