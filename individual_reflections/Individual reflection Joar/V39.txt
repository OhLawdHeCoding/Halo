Progress is coming along more smoothly now that we all have a little more experience with the technologies we are using. Estimating is still pretty difficult however as some tasks that were delegated a high amount of points were completed quickly and some that were delegated a smaller amount were harder to complete. When we consider a certain task we can either chose to implement the solution ourselves our find a third party solution in the form of some library (of which there are many in javascript). So some tasks that seem very complex can be solved easily by using third party solutions which can make estimating hard as we noted this week.
