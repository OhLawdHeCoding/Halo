\section{What we have done (A)}
We are currently facing climate changes more rapidly than ever seen before in Earth’s history. The main driver of this change is human activity. The entire world’s food system accounts for one quarter of the world greenhouse gas emissions. Of this quarter the supply chains (retailing, packaging, refrigeration, etc.) account for 18\%, and the remaining 82\% are accounted for by food production either directly (livestock, fisheries, crops for human consumption, etc.) or indirectly (land use, crops for animal consumption, etc.)\cite{FoodStat}. The purpose of this project is to make this data more readily available for consumers so as to enable them to make more climate friendly choices in their diets. 

This is accomplished by creating a website that lets the user search a database of food items and their equivalent carbon dioxide emissions. The user can then observe their (represented as a pie graph or, numerically, in units of total carbon dioxide equivalent kilos) emissions and compare the emissions of different food items.
