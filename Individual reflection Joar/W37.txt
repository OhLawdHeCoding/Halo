This week I have mostly been learning javascript. The syntax of javascript is verry unusual to me, so it has been a slow process. We were able to complete our minimal viable product in time. Our webiste now displays the entire database, and the user can search for individual items. We were all suprised by how easy it was to complete it. If we had known how easy it would have been, we would have completed more user stories this week. Going forward we will expand upon our MVP and with newfound confidence we can take on more user stories and hopefully progress even faster.
