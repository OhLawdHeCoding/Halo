The current most important issue is the new technologies we all are working with. They are HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and Node. None of us have worked with any of these technologies before so it is very much a learning process for all of us. Besides watching some tutorials and completing the weekly deliveries none of us have done much (reasonable, since we have not begun working on the project yet), so there is not much to reflect upon this week. Using Node, I genereated a prebuilt website complete with Javascript, HTML, and CSS (nothing that I wrote on my own, however. It was all generated by Node) and I messed around a bit with the code just to familiarize myself a bit more with the technologies we will be using. I do wish that we hade organized our team a bit more. I proposed that we divided ourselves into two teams; one that is in charge of all Javascript (including React and Node) and another in charge of HTML and CSS. However, since we have not officaly begun the project yet, we do not yet know what to expect and the large number of unknowns makes it hard to organize. This has been a calm week, surely in contrast to the weeks to come once we get started on the project.
